# Tuple Dice Game - README

## Overview
The Tuple Dice Game is a simple Python program that simulates rolling two dice. The game tracks the player's cumulative score and high score as they roll the dice repeatedly. Players can decide when to stop rolling and view their final scores.

This program uses the Python `random` module to simulate the randomness of dice rolls and demonstrates the use of tuples for managing related data.
